## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive web application that serves as a walkthrough and guide for the video game Stellar Blade. The goal is to provide detailed information about the game, including collectibles, main story walkthrough, side quests, characters, and items. The guide is designed to be user-friendly and interactive, allowing users to comment and engage in discussions about various aspects of the game.

## Current Status
This project is currently in the early stages of development, with the Collectibles Guide fully completed. While core features are being implemented, the design is still barebones, and many planned features are not yet functional. Regular updates are being committed as development progresses.

## Technical Features
The project utilizes the following libraries and features:
- **MUI:** The `@mui/material` library is used to implement skeleton loaders, which provide a smooth loading experience and a consistent visual design while the actual content is being fetched.
- **GLightbox:** The `glightbox` library is used for the image gallery and lightbox functionality, enhancing the presentation of the game's collectibles.
- **LocalStorage:** Utilizing `Local storage` for caching data, improving performance and efficiency by storing game-related information locally.
- **Lazy Loading and Suspense:** React's built-in `lazy` and `Suspense` features are leveraged to implement code splitting and lazy loading, optimizing the initial load time and reducing the bundle size.

## Completed Features
- **Collectibles Guide:** Detailed sections on all in-game collectibles with descriptions and screenshots.
- **Image Gallery with GLightbox:** Implemented GLightbox for an enhanced image gallery experience, allowing users to view collectibles in a lightbox format with smooth transitions.
- **Mobile Optimization:** The design is primarily built with Bootstrap, ensuring that the application is responsive and optimized for mobile devices.
- **LocalStorage API Caching:** Implemented local storage caching for API calls, reducing load times and improving performance by minimizing redundant data requests.

## Planned Features
- **Main Story Walkthrough:** Step-by-step guide through the main story.
- **Side Quests:** Information and guidance on all side quests.
- **Character and Item Information:** Detailed descriptions and stats.
- **User Accounts and Comments:** Users will be able to create accounts, comment, and discuss on different sections of the guide.
